‚öôÔ∏è 32-Bit Operating System Project (C Implementation)
This project is a self-contained 32-bit operating system built from scratch in C, showcasing implementation of core OS concepts within a virtual environment (QEMU/Bochs). It provides low-level insight into how operating systems manage memory, processes, and user interaction.
