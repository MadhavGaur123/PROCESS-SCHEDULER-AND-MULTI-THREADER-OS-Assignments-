‚öôÔ∏è 32-Bit Operating System Project (C Implementation)

This project is a self-contained 32-bit operating system developed entirely in C, built to run in a virtualized environment such as QEMU or Bochs. It demonstrates a hands-on implementation of core operating system concepts, offering insight into how memory, processes, and user-level interactions are managed at the lowest levels.
